# Social Distancing Devices
This project intended to mitigate the viral contamination in the context of the coronavirus pandemic by  using certain devices that regulate the distance between bystanders,
mainly in crowded and closed spaces. The first variation
consists of a stationary device that controls the distance
and pace of a queue. The other one is a wearable device
that helps the user to keep his distance from others. The
simulations were made on TinkerCad and theyâ€™ve shown a
high level of precision. There's a comprehensive article reporting the development of the whole equipment (portuguese).
