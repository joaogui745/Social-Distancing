### Social Distancing Devices
This project seeks to mitigate viral transmission during pandemics by using distancing devices
in crowded and closed spaces. The first variation
consists of a stationary device that controls the distance
and pace of a queue. The other one is a wearable device
that helps the user to keep their distance from others. The devices were prototyped using an arduino microcontroller and the TinkerCad
simulations have shown a high level of precision. There's a comprehensive article reporting the development of the whole equipment (portuguese).
